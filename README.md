## Following please find the instruction of the Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis by Dr. Peng etc.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:

## Making Plots

The task is to reconstruct the following plots which were constructed
by base plotting system.

For each plot:

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png', 
and `plot4.png'.

* Create the R code files include `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, 
and `plot4.R` that build the corresponding plots

* Add the PNG file and R code file to your git repository

When you are finished with the assignment, push your git repository to
GitHub so that the GitHub version of your repository is up to
date. There should be four PNG files and four R code files.

The four plots that you will need to construct are shown below.
