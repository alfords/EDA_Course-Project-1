# Following please find the instruction of the Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis by Dr. Peng etc.

This assignment uses data from
the <a href="http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/">UC Irvine Machine
Learning Repository</a>, a popular repository for machine learning
datasets. In particular, we will be using the "Individual household
electric power consumption Data Set" which I have made available on
the course web site:

# Making Plots and R code

The task is to reconstruct the four plots and R code files 
and push to the git repository .

For each plot:

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png', 
`plot4.png'.

* Create the R code files include `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, 
`plot4.R` that build the corresponding plots

* Add the PNG file and R code file to the git repository


The four plots are shown below.
