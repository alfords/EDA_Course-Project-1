### Making Plots and R code on Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

According to the course project 1 instructions, the task is using the 
"Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" to make
four plots based on the base plotting system and relative R code files, 
and then push them to the git repository.

* Fork and clone the following GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

* Construct the plots and save them to the PNG files with the width of 480
pixels and height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot file as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png`,`plot4.png`.

* Create the R code files include `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, 
`plot4.R` that build the corresponding plots.

* Add the PNG files and R code files to the git repository.


The four plots are shown below.
