### Course Project 1 for Exploratory Data Analysis

### Making Plots and R code

According to the course project 1 instructions, the task is using the 
"Individual household electric power consumption Data Set" to make
four plots based on the base plotting system and relative R code files, 
and then push them to the git repository.

* Fork and clone the following GitHub repository: 
https://github.com/rdpeng/ExData_Plotting1

* Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file with a width of 480
pixels and a height of 480 pixels.

* Name each of the plot files as `plot1.png`, `plot2.png`, `plot3.png', 
`plot4.png'.

* Create the R code files include `plot1.R`, `plot2.R`, `plot3.R`, 
`plot4.R` that build the corresponding plots

* Add the PNG file and R code files to the git repository


The four plots are shown below.
